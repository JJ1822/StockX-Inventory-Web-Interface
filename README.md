The Challenge:

StockX is looking to build an inventory system for storing shoes. We will need a web interface to
do this. Create a github repo to store your code in (If you would like a private repo for this, let us
know and we will set up a private one for you). Please follow the instructions below and create a
fairly simple inventory system.
Create a web interface using React.js
We will need a 5x5 grid to display the inventory shelf, each slot should show which shoe is
placed in it.
When a spot is clicked, we should be prompted to add, edit, or remove the shoe that is currently
in that slot.
We will need a form with the following fields for a shoe ( all generic text fields)
- Brand
- Style
- Size
- UPC ID
